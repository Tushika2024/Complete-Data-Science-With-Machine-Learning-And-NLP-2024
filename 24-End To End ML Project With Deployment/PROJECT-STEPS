1-)create a GitHub repository

2-)set up a local folder for project development

3-)virtual environment should be created inside the project directory to manage dependencies. 
This ensures all installed packages are contained within the project, making it easier to freeze and reproduce the environment later.
    --------conda create -p venv python=3.12.6 -y---------

4-)Activate the virtual environment
    conda create -n myenv //Conda stores the files in a central folder (like C:\Users\tushi\anaconda3\envs\).can activate these from anywhere using just the name.
    conda create -p venvnew // the files are placed right in your project folder
    ------------- conda activate .\venvnew--------   //.\ for current folder working in

5-)Initialize a git repository in the project folder and add a README.md file to describe the project
    ------git init
    ------git add README.md
    ------git commit -m "first commit"
    ------git branch -M main
    ------git remote add origin <repository_url>
    ------git push -u origin main

6-)Add a .gitignore file to exclude files and folders from being committed to the repository.

7-)Create requirements.txt for listing all dependencies  //lists all libraries needed for the project.

8-)Create setup.py for packaging the application //contains metadata and instructions for building the package

9-)To structure(create or ml application) the project as a package, create a src folder and add an __init__.py file inside it. 
    //__init__.py it treats a directory as a Python package that can be imported elsewhere. Without this file, Python might treat a folder as just a regular directory
    // allows Python to recognize the folder as a package.

10-)Install all dependencies and build the package
        -----pip install -r requirements.txt-----

11-) Creating project structure    //each folder contaning __init__.py file
    src folder    
            components folder (further contaning files)
            pipeline folder    (further contaning files)
            logger.py     
            exception.py
            utils.py  // For common functions used throughout the application, such as database connections or saving models.

12-) Setup logger.py and exception.py file and test the files

13-) Data ingestion.py
