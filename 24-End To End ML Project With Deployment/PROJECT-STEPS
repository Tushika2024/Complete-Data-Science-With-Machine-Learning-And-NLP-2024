1-)create a GitHub repository

2-)set up a local folder for project development

3-)virtual environment should be created inside the project directory to manage dependencies. 
This ensures all installed packages are contained within the project, making it easier to freeze and reproduce the environment later.
    --------conda create -p venv python=3.12.6 -y---------

4-)Activate the virtual environment
    conda create -n myenv //Conda stores the files in a central folder (like C:\Users\tushi\anaconda3\envs\).can activate these from anywhere using just the name.
    conda create -p venvnew // the files are placed right in your project folder
    ------------- conda activate .\venvnew--------   //.\ for current folder working in

5-)Initialize a git repository in the project folder and add a README.md file to describe the project
    ------git init
    ------git add README.md
    ------git commit -m "first commit"
    ------git branch -M main
    ------git remote add origin <repository_url>
    ------git push -u origin main

6-)Add a .gitignore file to exclude files and folders from being committed to the repository.
